## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/FilippoDeSilva/cursor-ai-bypass.git
  cd cursor-ai-bypass
```

2. Edit the configuration file:  
   Open `config.yaml` or `config.json` and set the variables based on your pc setup for more read `config.yaml`

3. Log out of your current Cursor account and close it. 

4. Go to your favorite temp mail provider (temp-mail.com) 

5. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py --all --config config.yaml #To run every script, you can choose your own preffered config file though.
    python main.py --help #To see all the available flags

    ```
6. Login to cursor with the temp mail 

7. All done!

## Known Issues:

- **Automated registration is not working:** but to be fixed on the next release I'd be glad on collaboration. 
- **Version bypass isn't working:** it's a failsafe method I could come up with it's not that important unless the user doesn't want cursor to auto update the IDE. So for now I'll give it a low priority.
